    /*
    Receives an integer n and returns the smallest integer that is greater than
    n and in which the sum of the digits is divisible by 11.
    For example, nextCRC(100) = 119 because 119 is the first integer greater than
    100 and the sum of its digits 1+1+9 = 11 is divisible by 11.
    Other examples: nextCRC(-100) = -92, nextCRC(20) = 29
